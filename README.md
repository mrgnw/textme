# Easily generate links to message WhatsApp, SMS, Telegram

Easily start new conversations in sms, Whatsapp, or Telegram using a generated link that uses the phone number to look up the user.

In addition to creating message links for multiple services (WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS), it normalizes the number so you don't have to worry about spaces, dashes, etc.

## Background
In WhatsApp, there's no easy way to message someone new without giving WhatsApp full contacts access.

Once you do give them full contacts access, starting a phone conversation with an unknown number via the search bar.

Without full contacts access, the workaround is to use a WhatsApp URL like [wa.me/+https://wa.me/+1234567890](https://wa.me/+1234567890), which would redirect to the new chat screen for +1234567890.
